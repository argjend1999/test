          Son Goku is a fictional character and the star of the Dragon Ball
          manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Serving as the main
          protagonist of the series, he is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son
          Goku in Japan and Monkey King in the West), a main character in the
          classic Chinese novel Journey to the West (16th century), combined
          with influences from the Hong Kong martial arts films of Jackie Chan
          and Bruce Lee. Goku first made his debut in the first Dragon Ball
          chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly
          Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984.
